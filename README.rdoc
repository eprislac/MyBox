This app is based on the Rails Tutorial "How to build a Dropbox-like sharing app using Ruby on Rails", by codyray, which can be found at http://codyaray.com/downloads/2012/03/How-to-Build-a-Dropbox-like-Sharing-App-using-Ruby-on-Rails.html. I have made several fixes to his code, no offense to codyray, as the tutorial was still immensely helpful, just a few words of warning to anyone who may attempt to tackle the tutoial theirself: 
1. The Tutorial is old, and some of the scaffolds generated by the plugins used may not look exactly as shown in the tutorial.
2. There are a few instances where codyray tells you to put code in one controller or model when it really needs to go into another.
3. You need to download rails.js and prototype.js and make sure they are included in app/views/layouts/application.html.rb in order for the delete links to work
4. You may need to futz with a few things after writing them in order for the methods to redirect properly (Folders Controller!)
5. Slight changes to the css (these will eventually be MAJOR changes)

If you download this code, please give a shout to codyray at his website and tell him thanks for all the great work
